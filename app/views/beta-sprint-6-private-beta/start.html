        <p>It is free to create an account for HM Land Registry’s licensed data and it takes about 5 minutes to apply. Once you have created your account, you can download all the licensed data files.</p>

        <p>You can start downloading data immediately after creating your account, if you use it for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>personal use, or</li>
          <li>a non-UK organisation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>HM Land Registry can take up to 2 days to approve your account if you use it for a UK organisation. It takes 2 days to run security checks. In most cases, you can use your account on the same day you apply.</p>

        <h2>Before you start</h2>

        <h3>Information you need to open an account</h3>

        <p>To create an account, you’ll need to tell HM Land Registry your name, email, address and phone number. You’ll also need to tell us if you’re a UK resident.</p>

        <p>Are you using the data for a UK organisation? If you are, you'll also need to include your organisation's:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>address</li>
          <li>type </li>
          <li>registration number </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Working for a non-UK organisation? You’ll need to include your organisation's: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>address </li>
          <li>country of incorporation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Why do I need to open an account?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a licence</li>
          <li>conditions of access </li>
          <li>a fee</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You must agree to the licence for each data file before you can download it.</p>

        <h3>Free data and data with an access fee</h3>

        <p>You do not need to pay anything to open an account and most of the licensed data is also free.</p>

        <p>There are a small number of data files with a fee. You can see the list of the data files with a fee (and their costs) on HM Land Registry’s fees page.</p>


        <p>The free data files are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>data file 1</li>
          <li>data file 2</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consequences of data misuse</h3>

        <p>Data files with a licence have usage restrictions (you can use the data, but you can only use it in a certain way).</p>

        <p>HM Land Registry asks you to create an account because of the legal consequences for data misuse. For example, if you sell the data HM Land Registry can share your account details with Royal Mail. Royal Mail may take you to court for data misuse.</p>

        <div class="govuk-warning-text">
          <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
          <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
            If you do not use the data according to the licence, Royal Mail may take you to court for data misuse.
          </strong>
        </div>


        <p>Read each data licence to find out how you can use the data. If you are not sure, HM Land Registry recommends that you check with Royal Mail: <a href="<a href="mailto:example@royalmail.com">example@royalmail.com</a>.</p>
