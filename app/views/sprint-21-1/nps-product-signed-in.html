          <p>
            The National Polygon dataset shows the indicative shape and position of each boundary of a registered title
            for land and/or property in England and Wales. Every title, whether freehold or leasehold, has at least one
            index polygon.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dataset contains more than 25 million titles and includes 28 million polygons. HM Land Registry index
            polygons are mapped against Ordnance Survey’s large scale map
            (<a rel="external" href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/mastermap-products.html">MasterMap</a>).

            are unique twelve digit numbers assigned to every addressable location in the UK. The information is created

            UPRNs provide a comprehensive, complete and consistent identifier throughout a property’s life. Cross-referenced
            with title numbers they enable files to be matched and merged with datasets from different sources to create
            valuable insight.
